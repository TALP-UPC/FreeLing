  #####             Java API for Freeling library                  ######
  #######################################################################

  This directory contains required files to generate a java API for FreeLing.

  HOW TO BUILD THE API IN Linux/MacOS

    1.- Install FreeLing 

    2.- Install Java SDK and JNI headers

    3.- Edit Makefile in this directory to adjust the right values of
          FREELINGDIR = directory prefix where you installed freeling (probably /usr/local)
          SWIGDIR = directory where swig share files are installed in your system
                    (e.g. /usr/local/share/swig2.0)
          JAVADIR = directory where java is installed (e.g. /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle)

    4.- Run 'make' to build the java API


  HOW TO USE THE API FROM A JAVA PROGRAM IN Linux/MacOS
 
    1.- Make sure that the directory contanining libfreeling.so
        ($FREELINGDIR/lib) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    2.- Make sure that the directory contanining libfreeling_javaAPI.so (created 
        by 'make' above) is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    3.- Make sure that the package "freeling.jar" created by make is in your CLASSPATH
 
    4.- Compile and execute the sample programs (or your own java program): 

         javac Analyzer.java
         java Analyzer

         javac SemGraph.java
         java SemGraph

   See FreeLing documentation and sample programs in src/main to
   understand what this sample program is doing.

  ================================================================================

  HOW TO BUILD THE API IN WINDOWS, USING MSVC

    1. Install java 

    2. Download and install swig (http://www.swig.org/)

    3. Open msvc project named msvc/10.0/swig/java/freeling_javaAPI
       Click right button over freeling_javaAPI.i, select
         Properties -> Custom build tool -> Command line -> Edit
       and change JAVA_HOME and SWIG_HOME to your local installations of Java and SWIG.

    4. Build the project, and when it completes successfully you'll find freeling.jar 
       and freeling_javaAPI.dll in freeling\APIs\java directory.


  HOW TO USE THE API FROM A JAVA PROGRAM IN WINDOWS
 
    1.- Make sure libfreeling.dll, libboost, and libicu are in a path where 
        they will be found.
        (e.g. set PATH=%PATH%;C:\my\freeling\installation;C:\my\libicu\installation)

    2.- Make sure libfreeling_javaAPI.dll (created by swig) is in a path 
        where it will be found.
        (e.g. set PATH=%PATH%;C:\my\freeling\javaAPI\installation)

    3.- Make sure that the package "freeling.jar" created by make is in your CLASSPATH
 
    4.- Compile and execute the sample program (or your program): 
        E.g.
         C:\my\java\installation\javac.exe Analyzer.java
         C:\my\java\installation\java.exe Analyzer

   See FreeLing documentation and sample programs in src/main to
   understand what this sample program is doing.
