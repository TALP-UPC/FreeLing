  FreeLing was originally written by people in TALP Research 
  Center at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (http://talp.upc.edu). 

  Spanish and Catalan linguistic data were originally developed 
  by people in CLiC, Centre de Llenguatge i Computacio at Universitat
  de Barcelona (http://clic.ub.edu).

  Many people further contributed to by reporting problems, suggesting 
  various improvements, submitting actual code or extending linguistic 
  databases. 

  A detailed list can be found in "Contributions" section at 
  FreeLing webpage (http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~nlp/freeling).
