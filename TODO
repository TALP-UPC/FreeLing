  TO-DO list for FreeLing

   * Improve chart_parser API to allow the incremental use of different grammars.
     After an analysis, the grammar can be changed and further analysis performed:
     either continuing from the status reached by the previous step, or from
     a "freezed" image in which a parsing has been selected and fixated.

   * Train bioNER and NEC modules for languages missing it

   * Develop dependency rules grammars for languages missing them

   * Improve capabilities of dependency parsing rule description language

   * Create dates_XX classes to recognize date/time expressions for languages
     missing that.

   * Create accents_ca class, to deal with catalan 
     accentuation in suffixing. Have a look to
     accents_es to understand the idea.

   * Create quantitites_XX classes, to deal with
     ratio expressions in languages missing it.

   * Create numbers_XX classes, to deal with numeric expressions
     in languages missing it.
