##########################################################
#
#  This file contains rules for phonetic encoding of
#  Spanish words in an adapted SAMPA standard, to
#  meet the needs of the corrector.
#
##########################################################

# Rules change from a sound (one or more letters) or a category
# to another sound or category, in a certain context.
#
# Category names can have only one letter are usually uppercase.
#
# Contexts must contain a "_" symbol indicating where the replacement
# takes place; they may also contain letters, categories, and the special
# symbols ( ) (to enclose optional parts), ^ (word beginning), or $ (word end)
#
# Rules can only change letters/sounds to sounds, and categories to categories.
# If a category is to be changed to another category, they should contain the 
# same number of characteers. Otherwise the second category will have its last
# letter repeated until it has the same length as the first (if it is
# shorter), or characters in the second category that don't match
# characters in the first will be ignored.
#
# Don't use regex metacharacters (except for the parentheses, ^, and $) in
# context specifications, category names, or sound codes.
