  Documentation for FreeLing
  ==========================

  This directory contains FreeLing documentation.  

  Since the documentation is available online at FreeLing webpage, documentation
  source is provided mainly for developers.

  The documentation is not generated by "make" nor installed by "make install"
  for the following reasons:

   1.- Generating the documentation with "make" will require the user to 
      have latex, doxygen, and latex2html installed, which will make
      things more complicated for the average user.

   2.- Including the generated documentation in the source package, ready
      to be installed, would largely increase the package size.

   Users interested in having a local copy of the documentation, can follow the steps 
   described below to generate it.
