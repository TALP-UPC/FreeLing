Code in the directory  src/libfoma

Is straightforwardly extracted from FOMA project
(http://code.google.com/p/foma)

The following modifications have been done to ease integration in FreeLing:

1) Add a line in "fomalib.h", exporting function to load a cost matrix:
    FEXPORT void my_cmatrixparse(struct fsm *net, char *my_string);

2) Replace the following function in "io.c" (and header in fomalib.h)
     struct fsm *fsm_read_text_file(char *filename);

   with:
     struct fsm *fsm_read_text_file(const char *buffer);

   The new function loads a dictionary from a text buffer
   instead of from a text file. 

3) Added fake function to "io.c"
     int isatty(int x) {return 0;}
   to prevent errors when compiling with MSVC
   (Foma tty interface is not used by FreeLing anyway)

4) Added ifdefs to the top of "fomalib.h" to deal with MSVC
