 FOLDER dict-management
 ======================

    This folder contains the source files and scripts needed to 
    generate FreeLing dictionary.

    If you want to add forms to the lexicon, or modify existing ones, 
    modify the source files and rebuild the dictionary.

    This folder contains two folders:

     bin: scripts to build the dictionary
     sources: source data files

   Source data files:
   -----------------

    You can keep any number of source data files. They may be
   organized by PoS, but you can also have different files for
   terminological entries, or for any other selection criteria you may
   be interested in.

    A word form can appear in different source files (e.g. with
    different PoS or lemma).

   Build the dictionary
   --------------------

    To build a dictionary, just run the script bin/build-dict, with 
    the files you want to include in the dictionary as arguments.

    Examples:

     - Build a dictionary with all source files:
         bin/build-dict sources/*  >dicc.src
 
     - Build a dictionary with only nouns and verbs source files:
         bin/build-dict sources/nouns.dat sources/verbs.dat  >dicc.src

     - Build a general dictionary enlarged with medical terminological nouns:
         bin/build-dict sources/nouns.dat sources/verbs.dat sources/medical/noun.dat  >dicc.src

    Default dictionary data for each language can be found at data/XX/dictionary (where XX 
    is the language code).

   Example
   ---------

    For instance, if we had the following files:

     nouns.dat         verbs.dat         adj.dat
     ----------------------------------------------------
     runs run NNS      run run VBP       tall tall JJ
     cat cat NN        runs run VBZ      better good JJR
     birds bird NN     eat eat VBP       tired tired JJ
                       tired tire VBD
                       tired tire VBN

  
    And we build the dictionary:

      bin/build-dict nouns.dat verbs.dat adj.dat

    We obtain:

       better good JJR
       birds bird NN
       cat cat NN
       eat eat VBP
       runs run NNS run VBZ
       run run VBP
       tall tall JJ
       tired tired JJ tire VBD tire VBN
